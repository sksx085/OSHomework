Child Process Output: h which we were groping, and I found my attention wander so continually from the action to the fact,
Child Process Output:  that I at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the event
Child Process Output: s of the day. Supposing that this unhappy young man's story were absolutely true, then what hellish 
Child Process Output: thing, what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time wh

Child Process Output: eal something to my medical instincts? I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper, which
Child Process Output:  contained a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon's deposition it was stated that the pos
Child Process Output: terior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by
Child Process Output:  a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have
Child Process Output:  been struck from behind. That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when seen quarrelling
Child Process Output:  he was face to face with his father. Still, it did not go for very much, for the older man might ha
Child Process Output: ve turned his back before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call Holmes' attention to
Child Process Output:  it. Then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be del
Child Process Output: irium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious. No, it was more likely to 
Child Process Output: be an attempt to explain how he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my brains to f
Child Process Output: ind some possible explanation. And then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If th
Child Process Output: at were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his overcoat, in his 
Child Process Output: flight, and must have had the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son w
Child Process Output: as kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries and improbabiliti
Child Process Output: es the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade's opinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherl
Child Process Output: ock Holmes' insight that I could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his 
Child Process Output: conviction of young McCarthy's innocence."Ah! who? I would call your attention very particularly to 
Child Process Output: two points. One is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool, and that the s
Child Process Output: omeone could not have been his son, for his son was away, and he did not know when he would return. 
Child Process Output: The second is that the murdered man was heard to cry 'Cooee!' before he knew that his son had return

Child Process Output: with the carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.k Lestrade called for us 
Child Process Output: "Yes, that is it." It was a widespread, comfortable-looking building, two-storied, slate-roofed, wit

Child Process Output: however, gave it a stricken look, as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it. We ca

Child Process Output: e blanched with terror, her hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of
Child Process Output:  a drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that moment her knees seemed to give w
