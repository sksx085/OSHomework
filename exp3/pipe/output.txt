Child Process Output: thing, what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time wh

Child Process Output:  contained a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon's deposition it was stated that the pos
Child Process Output: terior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by
Child Process Output:  a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have
Child Process Output:  been struck from behind. That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when seen quarrelling
Child Process Output:  he was face to face with his father. Still, it did not go for very much, for the older man might ha
Child Process Output: ve turned his back before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call Holmes' attention to

Child Process Output: be an attempt to explain how he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my brains to f
